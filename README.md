# ðŸŸ¡ Potentiometer-Based LED Brightness Controller

This project is a simple LED brightness controller built using an Arduino Uno and a potentiometer. The potentiometer adjusts the brightness of an LED, but the LED only lights up when the potentiometerâ€™s value crosses a defined threshold.

## âœ¨ Features

* Reads analog input from a potentiometer
* Maps the potentiometer value (0â€“1023) to PWM range (0â€“255)
* Turns the LED off if below threshold
* Adjusts LED brightness smoothly if above threshold
* Real-time monitoring of values via Serial Monitor

## ðŸ›  Tools & Components Used

* Arduino UNO (Microcontroller)
* 1 Potentiometer (10kÎ© recommended)
* 1 LED (any color)
* 1 Resistor (220Î©)
* Breadboard & Jumper Wires
* USB Cable for Arduino
* Arduino IDE (for coding & uploading)

## âš™ How It Works

1. The potentiometer value is read through the A0 analog pin.
2. This value is mapped to a PWM range (0â€“255).
3. If the mapped value is *greater than the threshold (128)*:

   * The LED brightness is adjusted according to the potentiometer value.
4. If the mapped value is *below the threshold*:

   * The LED remains off.
5. The potentiometer and LED brightness values are displayed on the Serial Monitor.
